Today is the first day of documenting the progress of Project Gamma - "Green Thumb". So far, we've finished our wire-frame diagram. Our main objective is to finish the endpoints for the API design. The third-party API we are using is called House Plants.

Friday February 10, 2023:

Today, we remodeled the API design based on the third party API. Instead of using “GetAll”, we decided to “GetByCategory” and “GetAllCategories”. That way, users will be able to view all 21 categories of plants, select and get redirected to see the plants that belong to each category. We also updated our endpoints. Rest of the day, we reviewed FastAPI.
