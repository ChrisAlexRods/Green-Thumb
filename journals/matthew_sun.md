    Today we start our repo and began journalling. We will be testing our local branches and pushing these journals onto the main branch
    in the repo. Our wireframe is mostly done and we plan to add our API endpoints. Endpoints will be drafted together on google docs before
    adding it into the project.

    We remodelled the front-end so that it is feasible with the functionality provided by the third party API. Instead of a search by plant name feature, we will now be retrieving categories of plants and allowing the user to navigate to a specific plant. We have also decided that almost all features of will require a bearer token, and that the unauthorized home page will be remarkably visual and informative about the features available by signing up in lieu of the lack of features.
    We have also changed some of our API end points to include the functionality provided by the third party API that we would need to code the changed features.
