Today, we have completed filling in the details in the wireframe and have started setting up our API endpoints. Our primary focus is on the API endpoints file, as we are using the 3rd Party House Plants API, which mainly involves filtering GET requests. We have also added a POST request for user sign-ups. Additionally, we have established our infrastructure and are in the process of transferring everything over.

Today we updated our wireframe and API endpoints page and gained a greater understanding of our project. We originally wanted to add a search feature that went through the third-party API's get-all plants list, but the API was designed for categories instead so we had to adjust both wireframe and API endpoints. We clarified some terms in the endpoints to match what we wanted. For example, our my plant's page became favorite plants to match the ubiquitous language/function of a favorite. We made a new category page, that shows plants within the category, and the final endpoint being the details of the plant from a category.
