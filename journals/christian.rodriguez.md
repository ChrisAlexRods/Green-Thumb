Today, we have completed filling in the details in the wireframe and have started setting up our API endpoints. Our primary focus is on the API endpoints file, as we are using the 3rd Party House Plants API, which mainly involves filtering GET requests. We have also added a POST request for user sign-ups. Additionally, we have established our infrastructure and are in the process of transferring everything over.

Feb 10, 2023:
Today we updated our wireframe and API endpoints page and gained a greater understanding of our project. We originally wanted to add a search feature that went through the third-party API's get-all plants list, but the API was designed for categories instead so we had to adjust both wireframe and API endpoints. We clarified some terms in the endpoints to match what we wanted. For example, our my plant's page became favorite plants to match the ubiquitous language/function of a favorite. We made a new category page, that shows plants within the category, and the final endpoint being the details of the plant from a category.

Today we set up our docker.yaml file and struggled immensely to get all containers running. We have issues with pc users needing to change their select end-of-line sequence to LF. We also had issues with the API container waiting and timing out so we couldn’t migrate. We got the db container up and running pretty much instantly so it was just the GHI and api containers we struggled with. We did end up managing to fix all our containers by commenting out the wait request until we migrated a table, and changing the end-of-line spacing to get our ghi container up and running. Once we verified that all containers ran we called it a night and watched the authentication exploration.

Feb 14, 2023:
Today we spent the time making sure after the pull request that everyone's container was running. There were some issues but we managed through them. From there we spent the majority of the time rebuilding our tables/migrations to what we wanted and setting up the queries and routers for the login/logout. We ran into some issues with the create functions with a particular index error causing our function to blow up. We went through the majority of the video so far.We eventually finished all the endpoints!!! After the post request everything went smoothly.

Feb 15, 2023:
Today we spent the majority of time dealing with our 3rd party API routes and queries. We did a get category, get plants within a category, and get a plant detail. We kinda got stuck in defining what the shape of our information was coming in as. Once we defined that some values were dictionaries and lists, we could finally get the information we wanted using the List and Union to get that information. We’ll see if we finish our final endpoints tonight but we’re making great progress today with sier or the instructor's help.

Feb 16, 2023:
Today we finished up our endpoints. We primarily dealt with the feature of favoriting a plant, getting all of a user's favorites, and deleting a user's favorite. For each endpoint, we authenticated them using the authentication we built two days ago. It primarily consisted of inputting account_data as a parameter and having an if or else statement. We had the most trouble writing the table in SQL and entering the table to see how the data was formatted(int, str). We also had some confusion with our data type being int or strings, but we resolved it pretty quickly. As of right now, we got everything and if we need to change anything I think we’ll be good.

Today we started frontend and struggled a little bit to incorporate bootstrap into our project, but once we figured that out we started working on our routes, main page, and the nav bar. Our main page was simple enough once we added our login buttons, logo, and title. From there we started the nav bar where some issues arose, but we handled them accordingly. From there we started frontend authentication and this is where we struggled a lot to understand the Learn. The instructions were unclear and we needed two Siers to even make sense of what was expected. From there we ended up struggling till the end of the day. Today was probably the first day where we couldn’t finish what we set out to do, but we’re getting closer.

Feb 22, 2023
Today we mainly worked on login with an attempt at fixing it and the logout. So far it does login a user, but the logout is acting weird by signing in a user anyway when they refresh the page. Authentication has been a big headache and I feel as if it isn't going to be the last of the headaches we’re going to face going forward. We did some work on the navbar to fix some bugs but most of the time was spent fighting with authentication to get it to work.

Feb 23, 2023:
Today we started by fixing some of the code in our backend and cleaning up both our routers and queries. This was a byproduct of us trying to figure out authentication in the front, but being unable to because of some routes not being authenticated. After we managed to fix that we then began to format our frontend code to fetch the categories from the api. We have authentication mostly figured out with some sier help, but it remains to be seen if it actually works.

Feb 24, 2023
I figured out the biggest problem with my endpoint and authentication was because the token was getting lost when I tried to reach my endpoint. Once I realized this I fixed it in my useEffect function where the token is now a parameter for when the page gets rendered and it keeps track of the token as it switches between categories. This was my biggest blocker so far in the frontend and it dealt mostly with the authentication and our routes not allowing the 3rd party api to load the pictures. We also connected the plant categories and my get plants by categories and finished a big part of our project.

Today we spent most of the day error handling and styling the page to what we wanted it to look like. Our api was changed this morning so the shape of the data changed with it. We spent the morning dealing with that in our backend and front end. It was a simple fix so after that we started the first stages of styling the page. The hardest thing to work on was the images from our api being less than stellar. Length, width, and resolution were a little rough to work with and we probably won’t finish today. The project is coming along really nice and today was minimal stressful.

Today we spent all the time working on the get favorites and delete favorites for today. The hardest part was easily getting the get favorites to work with our api. Our experience with Project Carcar was not that helpful in working out this monstrosity of an endpoint/react component. We also worked on the delete function to delete a favorite from our favorites page. We did some error handling and styled some issues with our 3rpd party api and spacing on the browser. For the most part, we finished two endpoints and the styling is coming along really nicely for our website. We also had to limit the number of favorites for a user because out API only allows 5 requests per second.

Today we finished all the endpoints that we made in the wireframe and started finalizing our styles. We first knocked out the post for the favorites by working through a 422 error and changing our routers to take in a user_id. From there we fixed a cors issue that involved two of our fields not allowing null/none and fixed that in the backend by adding a pipe. For the final endpoint, we added our quick care table to our main page and homepage. That was done in a matter of minutes and just needed some styling done. For the most part

03/02/2023:
Today, we mostly focus on styling our page. We focused on the fonts and spacing in between our cards. We changed some colors and moved some padding around. There was a quick error at the start but that took like a second to fix. Overall our project matches our wireframe.

03/03/2023:
We spent most of the time fixing fonts and dealing with an error that dealt with spamming the page to the point where it wouldn’t fetch from the api. From there we were still deciding how to style with fonts and shadows throughout our website. Overall we still spent most of the day styling. We also wrote our unit tests for each of our respective endpoints will little to no trouble. I did the get categories endpoint

03/06/2023:
After the test, we spent most of the time working on the about me section for all our group members. We imported a template from one of those template websites and dissected it to fit into our page to show all of us and our socials. We did some styling here and there with the fonts but the majority of the day was spent on the about me and translating it into JSX instead of HTML.

03/07/2023:
Today I spent most of the time writing the read. me for our group and running the backend linter to fix any issues. From there we spent the majority of the day all hands on deck trying to get this annoying footer to work. The worst part was the login where the footer would work on other pages but because the space was so big, the footer wouldn’t act the way it did. From there we managed to make a universal footer that could be applied to all pages and fixed any weird spacing issues. Overall the footer was probably one of if not the most finicky and annoying implementations that we have done today.

03/08/2923:
We finished styling for today and focus on adding graphics and finished fixing the footer. We added images and vectors to our pages to not make it bare and fixed the footer for all the pages. We ran the backend linter one late time and reformatted the code. The biggest thing we accomplished was the compilation of the feature page in the afternoon. We formatted the file, added images, and styled it all in one day.

03/08/2023:
Today we decided to try to deploy our website. It went pretty badly. We struggled hard with setting up the docker file to prep for deployment then got further confused by interacting with cap rover. From there we had an error where any endpoints that involved user data didn’t work such as the favorites. Once we resolved the issues(a single slash) we proceeded to deal with broken images and fixed them later. It’s still a mess but it works?
