Today we got most of our front end done. We got all our end points to work and implement them. We had to fix our routers in case color of blooms and blooming season

Today I did our favorites page and fixed our endpoints to get more information from our api. We retrieved our favorites and fixed styling on our front end. We created a functional delete button on the favorites page. We helped Ciana create a favorites table in the her database so she could add favorites. We found out that we can only have 5 favorites due to our api.

Today I styled the homepage and made a homepage css file. I was able to add a animated background with our logo. I styled the carousel with our picks for favorite house plants and linked our favorite plants to the corresponding page so users can see the plants details. Our api changed so we had to fix it so the data matched the structure of the api.

Today we separated and worked on our pages. I worked on separating the feature page and home page. I put a carousel on the home page using bootstrap. We worked as a group to figure the token on the get by category page and then found out one of the categories doesn't have a endpoint so we had to get in touch with the api creator and they said they would fix it tonight! I added the new home page to routes and adjusted the feature page.

Today Christian was our driver for coding. We were able to set up our Catergories page. We hit the api for the first time and came up with some hurdles. We had to trouble shoot with our token and formatting. We talked about separating our home page and making a feature page.

Today Matthew was our driver for coding. We were able to figure out why our login was giving us a 422 error (wrong case in some places). We were able to use useNavigate to redirect a logged in user to another page. We setup the sign up page to where a user has to input their name, email, password, and confirm password. We also set an alert for if the passwords do not match. We started our home page. In our nav we set it so there is a dropdown for when logged in. We ran into bug when we went to log out and our bar was still showing buttons as if you were logged in. We installed redux into our project.

Today Ciana was our driver for coding. We started our front-end. We made a functionable login button that redirects to the login page. We made the Nav file and added our logo to the navigation bar. We made a signup button also. We also started the front-end authorization and made a token file. We got stuck with the login authorization.

Today Christian was our driver for coding. We made our favorites endpoints. We made a favorites table, query and router. While trying to test it out we ran into an error where we had too many arguments when we just wanted to pass in a user id, plant id(api id), and id. We used the JWTdown docs to helps us resolve this error. We made a endpoint for create a favorite, show all favorites, and delete a favorite.

Today we made the endpoints to get all plant categories, plants of a specific category, and plant details. We made the plant query and plant router files and tested our endpoints with FastAPI. We looked at docs and explorations for help. Ciana was our driver today in coding and did all the typing while we shared through our slack.

Feb 14 2023
Today we got everyone to run their docker containers. I had to switch my setting from CRLF to LF on my vs code in my run.sh to get my ghi container to work. I coded today and we got our database done(problem solved our way with SQL and pgadmin) and did Authentication with JWTdown to set up a easy login/logout and create a new user. We also made a protected route that a user has to be logged in to have access.

Feb 13 2023
Today we worked together to set up our project. We ran into some hiccups getting our docker to run.

Feb 10 2023
Today we updated our wireframe on Excalidraw to match our API endpoints. We had to adjust our endpoints to match our external API. We had to change the way our "search" page looks by doing category buttons that a user can then click and see a list of plants within that category. The user then can click on a button to add to Favorites or click on the plant card to view the plant's details.

Feb 9 2023
Today we got our repository up and running and started our journaling. We finished up our wireframe on Excalidraw and API endpoints and inserted into our project on VSCode.
