Today we got everyone to run their docker containers. I had to switch my setting from CRLF to LF on my vs code in my run.sh to get my ghi container to work. I coded today and we got our database done(problem solved our way with SQL and pgadmin) and did Authentication with JWTdown to set up a easy login/logout and create a new user. We also made a protected route that a user has to be logged in to have access.

Today we updated our wireframe on Excalidraw to match our API endpoints. We had to adjust our endpoints to match our external API. We had to change the way our "search" page looks by doing category buttons that a user can then click and see a list of plants within that category. The user then can click on a button to add to Favorites or click on the plant card to view the plant's details.

Today we got our repository up and running and started our journaling. We finished up our wireframe on Excalidraw and API endpoints and inserted into our project on VSCode.
